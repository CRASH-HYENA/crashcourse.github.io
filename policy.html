        <p>8.

Under such circumstances, no Attendee or accommodation fee paid will be refunded.</p>
        <p>9. Any Attendee is allowed to roam the common areas of the site that are accessible but must get permission from the residents of another lodge before they can enter. Any attendee caught entering a lodge without permission from the people living there may be subjected to immediate removal from the site.</p>

        <p>11. You are allowed to act in light-hearted general animalistic role play in public areas, such as those allowed at other UK furry conventions. Any play must not become sexual or cause a nuisance to other Attendees or the Venue, and you may be asked to stop.</p>
        <p>12. The wearing of leashes, collars, and harnesses is allowed in the venue at all times, and gentle tugging and pulling of leashes/chains will be permitted. No force is to be used when holding any leash, harness, collar, or other similar accessory in public areas in the Venue.</p>
        <p>13. Any fursuit, costume, outfit, or accessory that is lockable and cannot be unlocked by the wearer accepts that in the case of an issue, emergency, or if a staff member or steward believes there is a welfare concern, force may be used to remove the outfit, and Crash Course accepts no responsibility for damages to any costume, outfit, or accessory.</p>

        <h3>Convention Staff</h3>
        <p>1. To keep everybody safe, ‘Staff’ will be identified by a unique badge throughout the Convention. If you are unsure of something, want to report something, or discuss whether something is allowed or not, please ask. Staff will also be available on the website so you can check who is staff prior to the event and familiarise yourself.</p>

        <h3>Clothing and Outfits</h3>
        <p>1. Fursuits, pup hoods, and costumes are encouraged. Please be mindful of your surroundings and ensure that your suit or outfit does not cause inconvenience or harm to others and be mindful of suiters having low visibility. Any items left in publicly accessible areas of the site are there at the owner's risk. Crash Course Weekend does not hold responsibility for item loss or damage. No genitalia should be visible in public areas at any time.</p>

        <p>1. Real weapons are not permitted in the Venue.</p>

        <p>3. If you are bringing an animal, they must not be brought into unsafe environments and correctly fed and taken care of.</p>

        <p>5. Physical advertising (posters, flyers, business cards, etc.) not from Crash Course must be confined to designated, clearly marked locations. Lodge door signs are welcome but must be taken down before checking out.</p>

        <p>2. STICKERS! We know fursona stickers are handed out often at events, and we love to see creativity in our community. However, we must stress that stickers are ONLY to be put on dedicated sticker walls or boards clearly signposted. ANY stickers placed on private property will be considered criminal damage, and the person could be liable for the damage.</p>
        <p>3. Leaving a tip instead of a mess would certainly be held in much higher regard.</p>
        <p>4. You are required to ask your roommates for permission before running a room party or inviting guests.</p>
        <p>5. You may not disturb people in any other Venue lodges. Attendees must keep noise down during the quiet hours (11pm - 6am).</p>

        <p>2. These rules will not be debated during the Convention. Staff from Crash Course will, however, be available for you in case you feel you have been incorrectly or wrongly accused of violating any of the rules. Decisions by Crash Course or the Venue are final.</p>
        <p>3. Crash Course reserves the right to impose any sanctions against violators of these rules or persons involved in any other unacceptable behaviour. The definition of unacceptable behaviour remains at the sole discretion of Crash Course or the Venue Staff.</p>
        <p>4. Sanctions for violating the rules may range from a friendly reminder to a permanent ban from the Convention.</p>
        <p>5. If you have any problems with other Attendees or Staff, please contact staff or con founders.</p>
        <p>6. When in doubt, please ask – preferably before the Convention starts. We will gladly answer all your questions.</p>
